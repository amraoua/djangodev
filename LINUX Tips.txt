Ctrl+X Exit the editor. If you've edited text without saving, you'll be prompted as to whether you really want to exit.
Ctrl+O Write (output) the current contents of the text buffer to a file. A filename prompt will appear; press Ctrl+T to open the file navigator shown above.
Ctrl+R Read a text file into the current editing session. At the filename prompt, hit Ctrl+T for the file navigator.
Ctrl+K Cut a line into the clipboard. You can press this repeatedly to copy multiple lines, which are then stored as one chunk.
Ctrl+J Justify (fill out) a paragraph of text. By default, this reflows text to match the width of the editing window.
Ctrl+U Uncut text, or rather, paste it from the clipboard. Note that after a Justify operation, this turns into unjustify.
Ctrl+T Check spelling.
Ctrl+W Find a word or phrase. At the prompt, use the cursor keys to go through previous search terms, or hit Ctrl+R to move into replace mode. Alternatively you can hit Ctrl+T to go to a specific line.
